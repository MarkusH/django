============
Django's API
============

This section of Django's documentation describes Django's internals from a
algorithmic level opposed to other areas of the documentation. It should not be
seen as what a function signature looks like, rather than how certain larger
parts work.

.. warning::

    This chapter of the documentation describes Django internals that are not
    necessarily part of the public API and may change without further notice!
